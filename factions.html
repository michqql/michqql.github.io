										<h2>About the project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										The original Guilds plugin was different from other factions plugins and required
										special upgrades to protect your claim from raiders. <br>
										In total, this project has over 13,000 lines of code so far. <br>
										The project took several months, and is still in the works, but taught me a lot of
										valuable lessons over that time. <br>
										The project taught me a lot about working with Chunks to store claims,
										how to efficiently traverse these claims and so forth. <br> <br>

										My second revision, this time a personal project, proved to myself the amount I had
										learnt in the two years since initially starting Guilds. <br>
										So far, the project has player and admin factions, claims, members, roles and all the
										basic commands to get setup. <br>
										This project is in active development by me and I hope to have a release within a month.
										My next goals to add are base building as well as upkeep, in a similar style to Rust.

												<h3>The claim map</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The client I was working with did not want to have the map displayed via chat as many other factions servers do.<br>
												Instead, the map was to be shown through a GUI, as demonstrated on the left. <br> <br>
												To achieve this task, a lot of complicated maths went in behind the scenes to convert the set of chunks into a
												matrix, which I could then apply offsets to, allowing the player to move the map around to view a larger area than
												the otherwise 5x5 grid.

												<h3>Version 2</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Currently, version 2 is a work in progress. However, so far the basic factions core is implemented, including:
												<ul>
													<li>Factions structure</li>
													<li>Factions members and roles</li>
													<li>Claims</li>
													<li>All basic commands</li>
													<li>Admin commands</li>
												</ul>
												With these implemented, I am able to focus my efforts on implemented the Rust aspects to my plugin. <br>
												Ideas from Rust I want to add are base building mechanics, raiding, upkeep, structures/world events.
