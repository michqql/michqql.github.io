										<h2>About the project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										The project was initially started for free for a server called TreeGrounds,
										however, as the project expanded it becaome closed source. <br>
										Over a month of work went into this project, with many revisions of the GUI's
										until I was perfectly happy with their looks. <br>
										Overall, this project taught me a lot about working with clients to build a
										project to meet their specificication and then going above and beyond. <br>
										Furthermore, I learnt a lot about working with Spigot's Conversation API, 
										a topic I had previously little experience working with.
